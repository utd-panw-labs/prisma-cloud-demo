# Prisma Cloud Demo

The repository has 3 main folders: Terraform, DockerImages and Kubernetes and contains IaC necessary to:

- Provision an EKS Cluster and Bastion EC2 instance via Terraform.
- Build Docker images necessary to run the sample applications.
- Deploy a couple of sample applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

Note: The code isn't production ready and is intentionally misconfigured. This is only for demonstration purposes.
